FIND THE ISSUES IN index.ts, REFACTOR THE CODE AND EXPLAIN THE REASONING

Issue 1: "WalletBalance" and "FormattedWalletBalance" interfaces have duplicate properties.
Explain: Using extends keyword, the "FormattedWalletBalance" interface extends the "WalletBalance" interface.

Issue 2: "Props" interface might lead to confusion.
Explain: Rename Props to "WalletPageProps" to make it clear that it is the props for the "WalletPage" component.

Issue 3: The "props" argument in the "WalletPage" component might lead to slightly more verbose code.
Explain: Destructure the props object in the function signature to make the code more concise and readable.

Issue 4: The "getPriority" function does not depend on any state or props within the component.
Explain: Move the "getPriority" function to a global function. This way, the function is only created once and not on every render.

Issue 5: Property "blockchain" does not exist on type "WalletBalance"
Explain: Add the blockchain property to the "WalletBalance" interface.

Issue 6: The "blockchain" argument in the getPriority function should have string type.
Explain: Change the type of the "blockchain" argument to string.
