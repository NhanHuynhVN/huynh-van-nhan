FIND THE ISSUES IN index.ts, REFACTOR THE CODE AND EXPLAIN THE REASONING

Issue 1: WalletBalance and FormattedWalletBalance interfaces have duplicate properties.
Explain: Using extends keyword, the FormattedWalletBalance interface extends the WalletBalance interface.

Issue 2: Props interface might lead to confusion.
Explain: Rename Props to WalletPageProps to make it clear that it is the props for the WalletPage component.

Issue 3: The "props" argument in the WalletPage component might lead to slightly more verbose code.
Explain: Destructure the props object in the function signature to make the code more concise and readable.
